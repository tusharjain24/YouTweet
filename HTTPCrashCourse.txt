HTTP Crash COURSE

HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
HTTPS: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure
Difference: In HTTPS there is an extra layer than HTTP where the data is encrypted before sending it and decrypted on the other side. The encrypted data is not readable.

URL: Uniform Resource Locater
URI: Uniform Resource Identifier
URN
All the above are used for location

HTTP Header:
    Meta Data --> Key-value pair sent along with request and response
    Headers are also used for caching, authentication, state management (of user)

    Request Header ---> from Client
    Response Header ---> from Server
    Representation Header ---> encoding/compression (Because of Network limit of data due to Lag)
    Payload Header ---> data

Most common Header:
    Accept (will tell what type of data it will accept, mostly used in servers): Application/JSON
    User-Agent: will tell from which application the request has come from
    Authorization: Berear (JWT token)
    Content-Type:PDF,JPEG,PNG
    Cookie
    Cache-Control

CORS:(Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
    Access-Control-Allow-Method

Security:
    Cross-Origin-Encoder-Policy
    Cross-Origin-Opens-Policy
    Content-Security-Policy
    X-XSS-Protection

HTTP Methods:
    Basic set of operations that can be used to interact with server

    1.GET : retrieve a resource 
    2.POST: interact with resource (mostly add)
    3.PUT: replace a resource
    4.PATCH: change part of resource
    5.DELETE: remove a resource
    6.HEAD: No message body (response headers only)
    7.OPTIONS: What operations are available
    8.TRACE: loopback test (get same data) , (Mostly used for debugging: send response to a request to know from which proxies are used)
